# Argo Workflows for ELT Processes

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to managing ELT (Extract, Load, Transform) processes using Argo Workflows. It provides workflows that automate data processing tasks within a Kubernetes environment.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following:
- Access to a Kubernetes cluster with Argo Workflows installed.
- `kubectl` configured to communicate with your cluster.

## Installing the Argo CLI
The Argo CLI is essential for creating and managing workflows. Install it with the following steps:

``` bash
# Download the Argo CLI binary for your platform
curl -sLO https://github.com/argoproj/argo-workflows/releases/latest/download/argo-linux-amd64

# Make it executable
chmod +x argo-linux-amd64

# Move it to a location in your PATH
sudo mv argo-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/argo
```

## Running a Workflow
To run workflows, you'll need to define them in YAML format. Hereâ€™s a basic example of a workflow file (`hello-world-workflow.yaml`):

``` yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Workflow
metadata:
  generateName: hello-world-
spec:
  entrypoint: whalesay
  templates:
  - name: whalesay
    container:
      image: docker/whalesay
      command: [cowsay]
      args: ["Hello World"]
```

To submit this workflow, use the Argo CLI:

``` bash
argo submit --watch hello-world-workflow.yaml
```
